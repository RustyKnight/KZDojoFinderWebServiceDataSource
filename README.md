#KZDojoFinderWebServiceLibraryThis is an implementation of the [KZDojoFinderLibrary](https://github.com/RustyKnight/KZDojoFinderLibrary) which uses the [KZDojoFinderWebServiceClientLibrary](https://github.com/RustyKnight/KZDojoFinderWebServiceClientLibrary) to load data from a web service.

This is inteneded to be a bare bones implementation designed to provide a proofing ground for the web service and associated APIs.

This API provides no caching, so all data is loaded from the web service every time.
